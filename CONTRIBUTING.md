# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

Here are some important resources:

  * [Documentation of Symfony](https://symfony.com/doc/current/index.html) tells you where we are,
  * [Our roadmap](https://github.com/Mapsred/TicketingBundle/projects?query=is%3Aopen) to know where we are going.
  * An idea, Bugs? Create a [new issue](https://github.com/Mapsred/TicketingBundle/issues/new/choose).

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/Mapsred/TicketingBundle/compare) with a clear list of what you've done. 
Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine, should look like this:

    $ git commit -m " YourAction #TagOfTheIssue | The Detail "

Example :

    $ git commit -m "  Resolve #75 | Add ticket status history on detail page  "

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. 

We optimize with the commande of PhpStorm : CTRL+ALT+L

Thanks !
